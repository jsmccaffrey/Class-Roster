Req E.
In file roster.h:
#include “student.h”

In file roster.cpp:
#include “roster.h”

You must define the parse() and the add() functions now because we will need them in the next steps. Declaration for add is given in E3a. Declaration of parse is:
public void parse(string row);
The definition of the remaining functions may be deferred until they are required, that is, create stub functions (empty functions) for now.
